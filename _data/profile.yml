  <p>
    I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in applying machine learning and statistical methods to address questions in urban economics,
    with a particular focus on spatial data, policy evaluation, and the dynamics of urban development.

  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master of Science</strong> in Spatial Economics and Data Analysis at the
    <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>,
    where I serve as a Teaching Assistant under the supervision of
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=0Hm7fD0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Siqin Wang</a>
    at the <a href="https://spatial.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Spatial Sciences Institute</a>.
    My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and urban economics,
    with a focus on spatial data analysis, policy evaluation, and sustainable urban development.
    I hold a Bachelor of Economics from <a href="https://www.swfu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southwest Forestry University</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am also a Research Assistant at
    <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/" target="_blank">HKUST(GZ)</a>,
    working in the AI4City Lab led by
    <a href="https://wufan-zhao.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Wufan Zhao</a>.
    My work focuses on applying statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze remote sensing data and evaluate urban policies,
    with the goal of supporting sustainable city planning and spatial decision-making.

    <i class="fa-solid fa-rectangle-ad" style="color: #d60000;"></i>
    <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for collaborators and research opportunities</span>
    interested in machine learning, statistics, and their applications in urban economics and policy evaluation.
    My goal is to apply data-driven methods to better understand spatial economic patterns, assess policy impacts,
    and contribute to evidence-based urban planning.
    If you are interested in collaboration or would like to discuss potential projects, please feel free to reach out via email or WeChat.
