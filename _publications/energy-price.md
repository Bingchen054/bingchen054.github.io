This paper investigates the asymmetric and nonlinear relationship between supply chain bottlenecks (SCB) and consumer energy prices (CEP) across major economies including the US, UK, Japan, and South Korea. Using a quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) approach on monthly data from 1997 to 2022, the study finds that SCBs significantly elevate energy prices at higher quantiles—especially in the US—while sometimes reducing them at lower quantiles due to suppressed demand. Conversely, energy price volatility feeds back into SCB pressure, with varying effects across countries. The findings emphasize the importance of country-specific energy policy and supply chain resilience strategies in navigating global shocks such as geopolitical conflict and pandemic-induced disruptions.
